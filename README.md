# Hand-Gesture-Control-for-Games
This project is a hand gesture control system that simulates keyboard key presses using a webcam. It employs cvzone and opencv-python for hand tracking and pynput for simulating key presses. It recognizes gestures to control actions like acceleration, braking, and steering in games. Ideal for hands-free control applications.
